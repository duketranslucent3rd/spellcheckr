# Spellcheckr

[Documentation and demo](https://mitya.uk/projects/spellcheckr)

Spellcheckr is a JavaScript-based spellchecker that integrates into textarea tag. It provides a full spellchecker experience, and runs in one of two modes (or both):

- Contextual - misspelled words are highlighted as the user types.
- UI - misspelled words are highlighted in a separate UI when the user clicks the 'Spellcheck' button.

For contextual spellchecking, Spellcheckr provides a custom context menu for in-situ replacemet.
